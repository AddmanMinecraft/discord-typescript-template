# Discord.JS Bot Template

## Why?

This is a template I personally use and find useful. You may be
thinking, "There are 1000 other templates, why not just use
another one?" The reason I created this one is that almost
every other template I found was either too complicated or
not up to date. This template is simple, easy to understand,
and up to date (I'll try to keep it that way, but no guarantees).

It also doesn't have any useless commands. The only command I
have prebuilt is the help command. The help command is dynamic,
so as long as you set up the description of the commands you make,
it will automatically generate a list of commands.
